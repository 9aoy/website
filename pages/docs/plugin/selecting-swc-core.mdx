# Selecting the version

Currently, the Wasm plugins are not backwards compatible.
So you need to select an appropriate version of `swc_core` for your plugin.

Thie page documents the version of `swc_core` you can use for each runtime.

## Note for next.js

- [next 13.2.4 and up cannot execute SWC Wasm plugins, due to a bug of `next-swc`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/46989#issuecomment-1486989081).

## swc_core

If you use a version in a range of the title, the Wasm plugin will work for the runtimes written in the body.

### `v0.75.0`

We enabled strict mode of `rkyv` and updated `wasmer` to `v3`.

- `@swc/core@1.3.49` (Not published yet) ~

### `v0.72.4` ~ `v0.74.6`

We updated `rkyv` to `v0.7.40` and the bug is now fixed.

- `@swc/core@1.3.44` ~ `@swc/core@1.3.47`

### `v0.69.x` ~ `v0.72.3`

Due to a bug of `rkyv@v0.7.37`, you are recommended to use `nightly-2022-09-23` as the compiler if you are building a plugin for these targets.

- `@swc/core@1.3.40` ~ `@swc/core@1.3.42`
- `next@13.2.5-canary.5`
