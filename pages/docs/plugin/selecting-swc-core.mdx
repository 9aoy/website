# Selecting the version

Currently, the Wasm plugins are not backwards compatible.
So you need to select an appropriate version of `swc_core` for your plugin.

Thie page documents the version of `swc_core` you can use for each runtime.

## Note for next.js

- [next 13.2.4 cannot execute SWC Wasm plugins, due to a bug in old version of `next-swc`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/46989#issuecomment-1486989081).

## swc_core

If you use a version in a range of the title, the Wasm plugin will work for the runtimes written in the body.

### `v0.72.2` ~

- `@swc/core@1.3.43` ~

### `v0.69.x` ~ `v0.72.1`

Due to a bug of `rkyv@v0.7.37`, you are recommended to use `nightly-2022-09-23` as the compiler if you are building a plugin for these targets.

- `@swc/core@1.3.40` ~ `@swc/core@1.3.42`
- `next@13.2.5-canary.5`

### `v0.66.x` ~ `v0.68.x`

- `@swc/core@1.3.39`

### `v0.61.x` ~ `v0.64.x`

- `@swc/core@1.3.38`

### `v0.54.x` ~ `v0.59.x`

- `@swc/core@1.3.29` ~ `@swc/core@1.3.37`
